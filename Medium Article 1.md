Compounder: Smarter Farming
18 November 2020

Note: This is one of many articles we have migrated from medium.com due to censorship. Also there has been a big protocol upgrade but mainly just the tokenomics, the old details are still in the article though we have left notes of the change. Please click here to deep dive into more details of the upgrade.
Introductionâ€Š-â€Šwhat is smarter farming?
You will be compounding interest on your assets while also earning $CP3R as a rewardâ€Š-â€Šthis is smarter farming. Whilst Compounder provides competitive yield, all but one pool (CP3R-ETH LP) will guarantee zero risk of impermanent loss with the security of a 24-hour time lock.

We will examine yields, security and complexity of new pools that will keep our stakers comfortable knowing they have a competitive edge to other farmers. We hope to offer the next generation of high-interest returns.

1. CP3R / Compounderâ€Š -â€Š CP3R emissions
2. CP3R-ETH LP / Compounder â€Š-â€Š Uniswap LP + CP3R emissions
3. DAI / DAICurve â€Š-â€Š Compound interest + CP3R emissions
4. USDT / DForceUSDTâ€Š -â€Š Compound interest + CP3R emissions
5. USDC / DForceUSDCâ€Š -â€Š Compound interest + CP3R emissions
6. ETH / Compounder â€Š-â€Š CP3R emissions
7. UNI / Compoundâ€Š -â€Š Compound interest + CP3R emissions
8. YFI / YearnGovernanceâ€Š -â€Š Compound interest + CP3R emissions


Compounder DAOâ€Š-â€Ša treasury controlled by you
There are a couple strategies that earn profit for the DAO. It will be used to accumulate funds for integrations, bug bounties, more complex contracts, security auditsâ€Š-â€Šanything to provide value for our holders, by the holders.

The DAO will earn profit from 0.5% of every withdraw made in Compounder pools. And it will also earn from a 5% fee from the interest-earned through the Compounder strategiesâ€Š-â€Šnot from your initially deposited asset.


What's coming up?
The protocol really speaks for itself and will require updates and further improvements. However, there is not reason to stop improving foundational functionality to improve your experience when farming with Compounder:

1. Private Withdrawsâ€Š-â€Šfirst advanced farming protocol with privacy

We will be bringing a layer of privacy to Compounder by deploying an integration with tornado.cash in the protocol. This will allow for private withdraws from the poolsâ€Š-â€Škeeping your txs out of the eyes of others.

2. Governanceâ€Š-â€Šhave a say in how you earn, and how we all improve

Holding $CP3R is important! You will be able to have your say in how the collective will maximise your profits and how to spend the DAO treasury for things you want to see happen. Some example proposals would be:

â€¢ New Pools, Asset and Profit Strategies

â€¢ Emission Rates Adjustments

â€¢ Fee Adjustments

â€¢ Where to spend Compounder DAO Funds

â€¢ Burning $CP3R tokens

3. New Pool and Strategies

Compounder will constantly keep updated and always consider: high protocol returns, security of code and strategies, abundance and popularity of assets and community proposals as the pillars to new pools and strategies.

Securityâ€Š-â€Šmoney & security come hand-in-hand
All the smart contracts are under a 24-hour time lock, and we are actively seeking prominent members of the community to build a multi-sig council. The time-lock contracts are deployed for the token contracts and every single vault/pool contracts for your peace of mind. A professional security audit has been completed, click here for full report.

Tokenomics
â€¢ No VC, no pre-sale, no pre-mine, no funny business

â€¢ Hardcap/Max Supply: 1,000,000 CP3R - this is now 200,000 CP3R

â€¢ Total Supply: 92,000 CP3R - this is now 200,000 CP3R
â€¢ Total Circulating Supply at launch: 0 CP3R
â€¢ Current Emission Rate: 92,000/30 days - halving every epoch (30 days), next half December 10

Emissions happen as rewards as farmedâ€Š-â€Šfrom these emissions
- 80% for liquidity providers - this is now 93%
